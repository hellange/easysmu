# easysmu
This project has been imported from https://github.com/hellange/poor-mans-smu.git to have a stable demo that works for the EasySMU board.
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/

It works togehter with Arduino + EasySMU (DC2561A) and 5" capacitive touch screen.
