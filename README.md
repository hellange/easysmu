# easysmu
This project has been imported from https://github.com/hellange/poor-mans-smu.git to have a stable demo that works for the EasySMU board.
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/

Further development of the "poor man's SMU" UI will be done in  https://github.com/hellange/poor-mans-smu.git independently of the EasySMU board.

It works togehter with Arduino + EasySMU (DC2561A) and 5" capacitive touch screen (ref: http://www.hotmcu.com/5-graphical-lcd-capacitive-touch-screen-800x480-spi-ft811-p-301.html?cPath=6_16, https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/5-800x480-capacitive-touch-lcd-with-built-in-ft811-graphics-controller/).
